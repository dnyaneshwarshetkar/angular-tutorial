Angular Building Blocks
#1. Module
- A module in Angular is a container for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow or a closely related set of capabilities.
- Modules can contain components, directives and pipes.
#2. Component
 - Components are the main building blocks for Angular applications. 
 - Each component consists of: 
    An HTML template that declares what renders on the page. 
    A TypeScript class that defines behavior. 
    A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template.
#3. Templates
    - Angular template is html with property binding, event binding, interpolation.
#4. MetaData
    - MetaData is data about components, pipes, directives.
    - Which helps angular framework to understand and deal. 
#5. Data Binding
    - Property Binding
    - Event Binding
    - Interpolation
#6. Directives
    - Angular templates are dynamic. 
    - When Angular renders them, it transforms the DOM according to the instructions given by directives. 
    - A directive is a class with a @Directive() decorator.
    - A component is technically a directive. 
    - Types of directives
        - Structural Directives
            - Structural directives alter layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in the DOM
            - *ngFor
            - *ngIf
            - *ngSwitch
            - custom directive *hasPermission
        - Attribute Directives
            - Attribute directives alter the appearance or behavior of an existing element. 
            - In templates they look like regular HTML attributes, hence the name.
            - ngModel
            - ngClass
            - ngStyle
            - Custom directive (highlight)
                1. Building a Attribute directive
                2. Applying Attribute Directive
                3. Handling User Events
                4. Passing values into directive
