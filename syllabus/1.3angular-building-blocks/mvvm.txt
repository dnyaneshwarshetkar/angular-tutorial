- MVVM architecture
    MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) can be adapted to Angular, even though Angular primarily uses a component-based architecture. The principles of MVVM can help structure Angular applications in a way that enhances separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.

Components of MVVM in Angular
    Model:

    In Angular, the Model represents the data and business logic, typically encapsulated in services and data models (classes or interfaces).
    Services are used to fetch data from APIs, manage state, and encapsulate business logic.

    View:

    The View in Angular is defined by the component's template (HTML file) and style (CSS or SCSS file).
    The template displays data and binds to properties and methods defined in the ViewModel (Component class).

    ViewModel:

    The ViewModel in Angular is the component class (TypeScript file). It contains the data properties and methods that the template binds to.
    The component class handles user interactions and updates the Model through services.

Key Principles of MVVM in Angular
    Data Binding: Angular provides data binding mechanisms, such as interpolation ({{ }}), property binding ([ ]), event binding (( )), and two-way binding ([( )]), to connect the View and ViewModel.
    Dependency Injection: Angular's dependency injection system is used to provide services to components, promoting the separation of concerns.
    Component-Based Architecture: While Angular is component-based, each component can be viewed as a small MVVM unit, where the component class (ViewModel) manages the data and logic for the component's template (View).
